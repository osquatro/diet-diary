"Diet diary"

Overview:
Your task is to implement a simple diet diary application. Using a web client, a user should be able to record their meals and workouts in order to track consumed and burned calories on daily basis.


Functional requirements:
1. a user can record a meal (name and calories as a number)
2. a user can record a workout (name and burned calories as a number)
3. both meals and workouts are tagged with current timestamp and stored on server side
4. a user can see a summary (total eaten,Â­ total burned) calories per day in the form of a table


Other considerations:
Although this application will be used in the future by multiple users, you can skip authentication and authorisation part if you want to hardcode a user identifier for now. The persistence model used to store data however must take it into account and allow implementing such functionality if needed.

The "Diet diary" will be implemented as a web application initially, but it may be necessary to add a mobile apps soon. The backend part must be designed in a way to make it possible without major additional effort.
The backend should be implemented a JVM technology. The Completed solution should contain source code with a description of how to install / run it.

The Web client can use any suitable web frameworks / libraries. The Application will be tested using the latest available version of Chrome.


The successful candidate will exhibit:
1) approach to ensuring quality (faults, requirements coverage) in the solution
2) standard code patterns
3) algorithm development
4) ensuring code simplicity while achieving 1-3
5) Appropriate use of relevant unit tests, patterns, annotations and dependency injection preferred
6) examples of OO principles
